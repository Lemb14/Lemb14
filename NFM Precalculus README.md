`Need For Math: Precalculus is an innovative app that projects on all devices. When a user enters in the app, the user has the option to either enter as a guest or create a new account. It is recommendable for the user to create an account as it helps save player progress within the system. Once they have successfully logged in, they are presented with the lobby screen and a welcome with the user’s name beside it. On the bottom of the app, there are four icons that let the user access the settings, profile, gamemodes, and lessons.`
